# Project1

## About

This project aims to analyze data from the [Board Game Geek API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) to see if there are any trends across the publication year, and relations between the game categories and mechanics.

## Jupyter Notebooks

### queries/bgg_stats_query.ipynb
This notebook handles the data fetching from the BGG API. It fetches and exports into a CSV batches of 10,000 records, according to the `batch` variable. (`batch = 10` fetches board games with `id` 100,001 through 110,000)

### bgg_refine.ipynb
This notebook reads in `bgg_stats_all.csv`, which is a concatenation of all CSVs generated by `bgg_stats_query.ipynb`, and cleans up the raw data.

It deletes the image columns, and drops rows that do not have a publication year or metadata.

Result is exported to `data/cleaned.csv`.
